# KumuluzEE microservices on Kubernetes

In this tutorial we implement two cloud-native Java EE microservice applications, using KumuluzEE 
microservice framework, and demonstrate how to deploy them to Kubernetes cluster.

This example consists of two microservices; 
one for managing customer entities - module **customers**, and one for managing order entities - module **orders**. We add important cloud-native 
concepts and functionalities that are essential in microservice architecture, such as configuration management with 
MicroProfile API and service discovery. 

This example was used for the blog [Running KumuluzEE microservices on Kubernetes](https://blog.kumuluz.com/kumuluzee/kubernetes/2017/12/03/kumuluzee-microservices-on-kubernetes_part1)
